** TODO Expand to more workouts than just iron cardio
I would love to add other workouts like DFW or the Back to Basics (C&P Ladders with snatches or double front squats).

this process has been started. Originally I thought I would make separate classes for each type of workout (e.g., iron cardio, ABC, DFW). Now, I think I should have a single class with an added attribute ~Workout.workout_type~. I am currently stuck and need to take a break.
** TODO add a sort option for ~best~ command
** DONE identify when to use workout instead of session
