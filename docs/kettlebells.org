** TODO Expand to more workouts than just iron cardio
I would love to add other workouts like DFW or the Back to Basics (C&P Ladders with snatches or double front squats).

Originally, I thought I would make separate classes for each type of workout (e.g., iron cardio, ABC, DFW). Now, I think I should have a single class with an added attribute ~Workout.workout_type~. This is the way.

I added another attribute called ~Workout.reps~. This solves all of the problems for now. Next up is to build a random ABC workout. There are less options to choose from than iron cardio so it should go smoothly.
** TODO add a sort option for ~best~ command
** DONE identify when to use workout instead of session
