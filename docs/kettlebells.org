* DONE update readme for workout commmand

There are no more flags, just arguments that are passed in and then altered as needed in the ~workouts~ module.
* DONE Expand to more workouts than just iron cardio

I would love to add other workouts like DFW or the Back to Basics (C&P Ladders with snatches or double front squats).

Originally, I thought I would make separate classes for each type of workout (e.g., iron cardio, ABC, DFW). Now, I think I should have a single class with an added attribute ~Workout.workout_type~. This is the way.

I added another attribute called ~Workout.reps~. This solves all of the problems for now. Next up is to build a random ABC workout. There are less options to choose from than iron cardio so it should go smoothly.
* DONE add a sort option for ~best~ command

* DONE refactor functions into methods

~calc_session_stats~ and ~display_session_stats~ should be refactored into methods for the ~Workout~ object. One barrier is controlling for bodyweight. Currently, bodyweight is stored globally in the database under the key "loads". Perhaps, it makes sense to add bodyweight at an attribute for the ~Workout~ object. This way, when the global bodyweight changes, stats for any given session don't.

Currently reps are stored as a int for each ~Workout~. Maybe it makes more sense to store reps as a dict with each exercise as the key and the reps per set as the value. E.g., a classic iron cardio rep scheme would be:

#+begin_src python
{"clean": 1, "press": 1, "squat": 1}
#+end_src

Or, maybe, it makes sense to change the load, sets, and reps attributes to a single attribute called ~Workout.exercises~.

To start, I am thinking about including the following movements:

Kettlebells
+ TGU
+ press
+ squat
+ clean
+ swing
+ snatch

Bodyweight
+ pull-up
+ push-up
+ TRX pull
+ hip thrust

Although, I'm not sure I have to be explicit. In other words, users could add whatever exercise they want. They would manually set the load, sets, and reps. I could have pre-made workouts like Iron Cardio, ABC, and the Back to Basics Kettlebell workout, but users would have the flexibility to add what they want.

One idea I just had, offer the movements described as suggestions, but always have an "other" option that users can type in.

* DONE add improved help text

* DONE add a way to create custom workouts
CLOSED: [2023-11-07 Tue 17:49]
Also see [[rethink the workout object][rethink the workout object]] section for ideas. Perhaps I should move the constants into the database when it initializes. That would allow users to add their own exercises or whatever on top of all the current constants.

* DONE Add a program viewer (filter?)

It would be nice to see all the workouts of a certain type. Something like ~kettlebells filter dfw~. This would return a list of all of the DFW workouts from the datebase. Perhaps in a table of some kind.

After listening to the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLd_kXilVUM][Birth of Iron Cardio]] podcast episode, it would also be nice to be able to compare individual workouts.

The question becomes, how to include the data in a way that is easy to read.

* TODO add a command for descriptions of workouts
* TODO add links to exercise tutorials
* DONE add function make an easy strength template
CLOSED: [2024-03-16 Sat 09:54]
I would like to create a command that lets me build a template for my easy strength workouts. That way I don't have to keep updating the app in order each time I change the workout slightly.
** Questions
- Should it be saved in the database?
- How will I create new templates vs edit existing ones?
- Are there other programs that would benefit from this (e.g., DFW)?
* TODO add a time restriction to program viewer
Currently if you view a program you get the workouts from all time. It would be nice to be able to enter a start date and an ending date.
* DONE handle bodyweight exercises
